# KRKPA7-MLClassification

## Abstract
Chess is an ancient and legendary game that has epitomized strategy, pattern recognition, and intellectual computation of the mind for over a thousand years. The game has an endless combination of maneuvers and possible scenarios that continues to captivate the minds of millions. The Chess End-Game -- King+Rook versus King+Pawn 
on a7 (abbreviated KRKPA7) dataset is a specific collection of board descriptions that represents a particular end game scenario. In this research paper, numerous machine learning classifiers are trained using the KRKPA7 dataset in order to compare and determine the most accurate model based on various classification metrics, by predicting whether the outcome of the board is a 'win' or 'no-win'. These models are trained and implemented using the PyCaret library, an open-source, low code machine learning library in Python. The results indicate the most accurate models are those using boosting and bagging (bootstrap aggregating) techniques, signifying the importance of ensemble methods when classifying on the KRKPA7 dataset.
